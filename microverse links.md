Introduce you self examples
Good Examples for Students with No Development Experience:

"Hi, friend! I'm Muhammad, and my biggest goal in life is to use software engineering to help environmental organizations change the world, one line of code at a time."

"Hello! My name is Ana and I'm a full-stack development student currently enrolled in a remote software development school that uses pair-programming and real-world projects to teach development."

Why are these examples good?
The examples above first give the speaker's name, explain that the speaker is a software developer, and then explain what value the speaker can add to a business or work relationship.

Helena has experience with multiple languages/frameworks and has built software solutions for small businesses; this would be a great pitch if she were meeting the CEO of an early-stage startup. Luis loves UX, UI, and accessibility; wouldn't he be great at improving old, div-soupy code? Muhammad is passionate about environmentalism: a recruiter at a green energy company would love to meet him. Ana doesn't have much experience yet, but she's enrolled in a school that uses real-world practices like pair-programming to teach development.

Your introduction will (and should) be different! But the essence should be the same: introduce yourself, give your job role, and talk about what specific value you would add to a business.

What makes you unique. #interview
To answer this question, I actually have a broad list of skills which make up my USP. The first skill that I will have to elaborate is my ability to learn new languages quickly. I inrolled in microverse, which is an online school for remote devdlopers, andI was able to learn languages like ruby, react, js html and more in a space of 6 months.
